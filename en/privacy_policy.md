# Every Door Privacy Policy

## You Upload To OpenStreetMap

With this app you make actual and direct
contributions to [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
There is no third party in-between the app and OSM infrastructure.

Editing OpenStreetMap anonymously is not possible. Any changes you make
(and their date and location) are attributed to your OSM user account
and publicly visible on the openstreetmap.org website. Because Every Door
should only be used for on-site survey, this reveals where and when you have used the app.

## Location

The app does not share your GPS location with anyone.
It is used to focus the map around your location, optionally downloading map tiles. 

## Contact Me

If you have any questions, ask [Ilya, the author](mailto:ilya@zverev.info).
