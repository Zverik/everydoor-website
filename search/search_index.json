For an already existing object (or a newly created from an NSI preset), we call <code>getPresetForTags()</code> from a preset provider.</p> <p>That method has got a lot of steps: checking for empty tags and <code>amenity=fixme</code> tags, asks plugins for an answer. But the main step is running a huge SQL query against the local SQLite database, which through clever CTE and sorting returns the one result.</p> <p>Is it good to have a single big SQL query?

We create a CTE for a <code>langs</code> table that contains two columns, language code and a rank, starting with 1. And we join the results with this table, ordered by the language rank.

You can notice how long the first loading of the editor pane takes. That's because in the collapsed \"more fields\" section there are dozens of combo fields.</p> <p>Finally, the method calls the long <code>fieldFromJson</code> function from <code>field.dart</code>.

Not map maintenance.</li> <li>Fewer buttons and menus: heuristic is preferable to a setting, and every button benefits the surveyor.</li> </ol> <p>Those principles can be circumvented with plugins, but they regulate the core experience.</p>"},{"location":"develop/design/#data-complexity","title":"Data Complexity","text":"<p>The first principle says: we're editing only points.

For example, no drawing building contours or setting addresses to enclosed amenities. No detecting nearest streets and no painting downloaded OpenStreetMap data. All you have from OSM is a <code>OsmElement</code> object that has a point location. That's by design.</p> <p>If you think that to be limiting, consider also options for circumventing that. Like, instead of tracing streets (from imagery), you have a free-form drawing in the Notes mode, less consequential and hence more freeing.</p> <p>OpenStreetMap data model is unfortunately too complex in regard to object interdependencies. Adding <code>way</code> and <code>relation</code> processing would require support for splitting, adjusting, straightening, and also correctly processing restriction and route relations. As a result, we would have the second Vespucci or Go Map, and that's not the goal.</p> <p>Instead, we are focusing on representation and hiding the data model. Users edit not nodes and tags, but buildings and shops. That's why we have multiple modes: while pedestrian crossings and building entrances are denoted by nodes in ways, they belong to totally different classes and need to be considered differently. We are thinking in terms, not what is possible to do, but what exactly and with which purpose a user wants to do something. And from that, we devise a user interface.</p>"},{"location":"develop/design/#screen-estate","title":"Screen Estate","text":"<p>Most phones are smaller than a computer screen. Actually, often we have a 5\" or 6\" rectangle. How do we fit an entire geospatial editor inside? QGIS has 74 buttons by default just on the toolbar. JOSM has ~40 on two, plus multiple side panels. iD looks lean: it only has 20 buttons and one permanent sidebar. That is too much context one has to keep in their head, and too much controls for a small screen.</p> <p>Every Door does not approach this as an excercise of hiding things behind other things. No infinitely deep menus like in OsmAnd, no buttons behind buttons like in OsmTracker. It's not a general purpose editor, and that allows us to shrink focus, to allow for less at any given time, and thus opening more of the screen to the task at hand.</p> <p>The third principle says, instead of a switch, just choose a state based on the context. Instead of a button, try finding an interaction that comes naturally and does not require an always-on control. If an interactive control is not used in ten minutes of hardcore mapping, it should go.</p> <p>That's why every new thing on the screen has to be properly thought out, maybe gaining extra functions and proving itself over months of field testing, before it goes into the app. It has to be useful for every user, not in specific circumstances.

Like the name, brand, wikipedia and wikidata links, cuisine, fuel types etc. And you might make typos in the process. To avoid this redundant work, the Name Suggestion Index was created to catalogue tagging for common franchises and brands, both local and global.</p> <p>At the base level, an NSI entry is just a name and a list of tags to put on an object. And maybe some terms to make searching easier. In Every Door, you search for a brand, get a gray tile with it, tap it, and get an editor pane with all tags pre-filled. Entries also include an area where the brand is active, <code>\"001\"</code> meaning the entire world. It commonly looks like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n  \"displayName\": \"Frasers\",\n  \"id\": \"frasers-3fbcc0\",\n  \"locationSet\": {\"include\": [\"na\", \"za\"]},\n  \"tags\": {\n    \"brand\": \"Frasers\",\n    \"brand:wikidata\": \"Q116740926\",\n    \"name\": \"Frasers\",\n    \"shop\": \"bag\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>To contribute to NSI, you must know the project structure and the meaning of properties. They are documented on the wiki: see the Overview, Category Files for the schema, and a guide on Adding missing entities.</p> <p>Locally, you can have an NSI preset in a plugin. For that, simply omit the <code>fields</code> list. Note that NSI presets do not participate in type detection, so you will see \"Post Box\" in the micromapping legend for any post box, even a branded one that has an NSI entry for it.</p>"},{"location":"develop/presets/#personal-presets","title":"Personal Presets","text":"<p>Some presets are not meant to go into iD or other public instances: they are too local, too focused on the task.

Its base mode of operation is, you look at amenities around you and find those in the list. Same way, other modes often work better with a satellite imagery.</p> <p>Except when you have no imagery. Or are inside a building, and mapping shops while staring at a roof is not fun. Or the GPS is failing, and you have to find your location manually. There can be many reasons why people resort to using [obsolete] OSM tiles while mapping, dealing with discrepancy between what's on the server, and what's on the phone. The main reason I was keeping in mind was offline work.</p> <p>For a rectangular area roughly 1\u00d71 km you would need to pre-download ~1400 tiles, amounting to ~40 megabytes for a city. Same would take only 200 kilobytes with a vector tile, of which you would need just one (at zoom 14). Which is 200 times less data and thousand times less load on the server.</p> <p>This enables Every Door to work offline by pre-downloading tiles: each vector tile covers an 1\u00d71 km area, which means, you need very few of them to map even a big rural area. And tile downloading limits won't pose an issue.</p> <p>Alas at the last moment I've decided to not make vector tiles the default. Since the MapLibre package is not yet of production quality, the app uses a slower library, and in both rendering options it provides, rendering was too slow, and had some weird artifacts. So to enable vector tiles, please open the plugins pane, and install the Vector Base Map plugin.

Obviously data and vector tiles cover all the zoom levels, while raster tiles are downloaded up to zoom 18 (which makes it 85 tiles downloaded for each selected rectangle).</p> <p>Everything downloaded stays in a separate cache, so even when you pan and zoom the map too much, nothing explicitly requested will be silently deleted, like it happens with the regular tile cache.</p> <p>Note: the bottom button for downloading tiles might be hidden by the phone UI on Android.

With that, you can use that scheme for versioning, in the form of <code>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</code>. For example, <code>0.1</code>, <code>1.0</code>, <code>1.1</code>, and so on.</p> <p>Internally those versions are converted into a single number by multiplying the major version by a thousand, and adding a thousand.

This \"current color\" is what will be replaced with the icon color value.</p> <p>Raster images are converted to black-and-white on its transparency layer, and the color is set to all non-transparent pixels.</p> <p>Another option for fast prototyping is to use an emoji character for an icon. Two drawbacks of that are, emoji are not recolorable, and the alignment is slighly off.
