# Every Door 6.0

_Releasing in June._

This release is focused on one thing people (and the author too) have been asking since 2022:

## Plugins



## Amenity Editing

* POI on the map turn green when confirmed.
* (+) buttons for the first two modes can also be dragged onto the map.
* Correct weekday order and default holidays for various countries.
* Untyped amenities with just a name will be converted to OSM notes.
* "Clear" button for the fixme field (thanks @soham-dixit).

## Other

* Turns out "Cancel" buttons for buildings and entrances kept the changes.
* Removing preset tags properly.
* Now warning about `amenity=fixme` objects.
* All main keys are now prefixed with `disused:`, e.g. `amenity` and `healthcare`.
* Compass direction (thanks @SiarheiFedartsou).
* Profile page looks a bit better (thanks @soham-dixit).
* Added `sr-Latn` language for Serbia (thanks @alnzrv).
* Updated roof assets (thanks @mxdanger).
