# Quick Start

Every Door is closer to JOSM than to StreetComplete, MapComplete or iD.
In this editor, you download data, edit it without connecting to the net,
and regularly upload changes back to OpenStreetMap.

Similarly to JOSM or MapComplete, you do not see everything at once, but
choose a layer, a mode to work with. Mode buttons are at the bottom
of the screen:

- Micromapping. Here you map benches, trees, lamp posts, post boxes,
  and pedestrian crossings.
- Amenities. Things or venues that provide services, often for money
  or for external funding. Shops, museums, vending machines.
- Buildings. Collect addresses and building attributes like height.
  Also for entrances, especially useful for big apartment buildings.
- Notes. Both OSM notes and GeoScribbles: draw geometry on the screen
  with your finger to trace it later with a proper device.

During a walk you may feel a need to switch a layer every minute.
It will be tiring, and you can burn out this way. We recommend focusing
on a narrow set of things to collect: like shops, or benches. Mapping
should feel relaxing and fulfilling, a joy of a pastime.
