# Developing and Translating Presets

The editor uses [presets from iD](https://github.com/openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema):
they are managed in a dedicated repository and translated on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/openstreetmap/id-editor/translate/#ru/presets/).

Brands are managed in the [Name Suggestion Index](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index).
