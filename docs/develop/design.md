# Design Principles

Every Door is a highly opinionated editor. Which means, it makes a lot of assumptions
on behalf of the user, and pushes for a few optimized workflows. Core principles are
described in the [readme](https://github.com/Zverik/every_door/blob/main/README.md#design):

1. ED displays and edits only tagged nodes and polygons represented with their centerpoints. No roads.
2. ED focuses on surveying: adding and detailing things that you can see around you. Not map maintenance.
3. Fewer buttons and menus: heuristic is preferable to a setting, and every button benefits the surveyor.

Those principles can be circumvented with plugins, but they regulate the core experience.

_TODO: explain everything, with examples._
