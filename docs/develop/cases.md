# How To Find Things

The size of the code might be daunting (it is for me, the author), so this section

Note that the code is in a constant (but glacial) flux, so some of those might be
possible to change with a plugin in the future.

As mentioned in the [plugin docs](../plugins/metadata/presets.md), "standard fields" is
a third group of fields that gets added on top of "fields" and "more fields" for every
object in the editor panel. This chapter traces its addition, marking what and where
can be improved.

understand how providers interact, and how the data is packaged.
