# Contributor's Guide

Every Door needs your help!

There are multiple ways you can contribute. The main one being, take the app and
go outside to map! Walk around a shopping district, map everything at a playground,
bike into a forest and try drawing forest paths. That's the best way to test
everything the app has to offer, and also gain ideas on how it may help you better.

Other that that,.. everything still. Starting with the icon: imperfect, sketchy, like
the app itself. Maybe it's time to become more serious? Same with this website: the landing
page needs to be more inviting. And maybe in more languages than one.

And code. The road map has like a hundred items on it, and people are always asking for more.
Look into plugins, and if they don't cover what you want, try cloning the repository,
learning Dart and Flutter, and improving the app.

This section guides you around all the ways you can contribute.
