title: Every Door Plugins
---
Every Door editor can be extended, thanks to [NGI0 grant](https://izv.ee/everydoor/ngi0/customization). You can add new modes, new imagery, and soon replace presets and communicate with third-party API.

A plugin is a zip-archive with an `edp` extension, which includes a `plugin.yaml` file inside at the top level. All other files are optional.

To test this, install Every Door from [this URL](https://osmz.ee/everydoor-6.0-alpha4.apk).

These sections explain how to use and write plugins:

* [Installation](install.md)
* [Metadata](metadata/index.md)
* [Code](code/index.md)
* [Publishing](publish.md)
