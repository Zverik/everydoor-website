title: Every Door Plugins

Since version 6.0, the editor can be extended, thanks to the
[NGI0 grant](https://izv.ee/everydoor/ngi0/customization).
You can add new modes, new imagery, replace presets and communicate with third-party API.

A plugin is a zip-archive with an `edp` extension, which includes a `plugin.yaml` file
inside at the top level. All other files are optional.

These sections explain how to use and write plugins:

* [Installation](install.md)
* [Metadata](metadata/index.md)
* [Code](code/index.md)
* [Publishing](publish.md)
